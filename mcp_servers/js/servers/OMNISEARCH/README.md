## Flexible API Key Requirements

MCP Omnisearch is designed to work with the API keys you have available. You don't need to have keys for all providers - the server will automatically detect which API keys are available and only enable those providers.

For example:
- If you only have a Tavily and Perplexity API key, only those providers will be available
- If you don't have a Kagi API key, Kagi-based services won't be available, but all other providers will work normally
- The server will log which providers are available based on the API keys you've configured

This flexibility makes it easy to get started with just one or two providers and add more as needed.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the server directory with your API keys:

```bash
# Search Providers
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_key
KAGI_API_KEY=your_kagi_key

# AI Response Providers
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_key

# Content Processing
JINA_API_KEY=your_jina_key
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_key
```

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the server:
```bash
npm run build
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```
